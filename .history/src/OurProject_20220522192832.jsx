      We chose a project that will help children who are not expressing
      themselves well and also children of preschool age. Specifically, we
      focused on speech therapy and speech defects. We came up with the game
      together, its basis will be the connection between parents and children
      and especially the effort to pronounce either letters or words correctly.
      There are levels in the game at which children must complete tasks. They
      have three lives to complete their tasks, and if they lose them, they must
      meet the challenge of Mr. badboy Čilík.

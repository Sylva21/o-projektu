      Hello, we are Sylva and Niki, girls who have decided to change their whole
      lives. We both have a goal, after graduating from the Digital Academy, to
      make a programming, if you want coding. What you should know about us is
      that we are both passionate athletes. We love movement in all its forms.
      Niki loves the dance with which she expresses her inner self and thanks to
      which she feels her own. And Sylva, on the other hand, loves ice hockey,
      in which she tries to break social conventions and capture opinions that a
      woman should be at the stove. Together they form an extroverted duo and if
      they meet together in a room, itâ€™s worth it.

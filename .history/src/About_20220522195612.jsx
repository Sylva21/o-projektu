        <li>
          Hello, we are Sylva and Niki, girls who have decided to change their
          whole lives.
        </li>
        <li>
          We both have a goal, after graduating from the Digital Academy, to
          make a programming, if you want coding.
        </li>
        <li>
          What you should know about us is that we are both passionate athletes.
        </li>
        <li>We love movement in all its forms.</li>
        <li>
          Niki loves the dance with which she expresses her inner self and
          thanks to which she feels her own.
        </li>
        <li>
          And Sylva, on the other hand, loves ice hockey, in which she tries to
          break social conventions and capture opinions that a woman should be
          at the stove.
        </li>
        <li>
          Together they form an extroverted duo and if they meet together in a
          room, itâ€™s worth it.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </main>

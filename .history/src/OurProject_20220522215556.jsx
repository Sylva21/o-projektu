          We chose a project that will help children who are not expressing
          themselves well and also children of preschool age.{' '}
        </li>
        <li>Specifically, we focused on speech therapy and speech defects.</li>
        <li>
          We came up with the game together, its basis will be the connection
          between parents and children and especially the effort to pronounce
          either letters or words correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are levels in the game at which children must complete tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          They have three lives to complete their tasks, and if they lose them,
          they must meet the challenge of Mr. badboy Čilík.
        </li>
      </ul>

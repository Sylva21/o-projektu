      <p>
        We chose a project that will help children who are not expressing
        themselves well and also children of preschool age. Specifically, we
        focused on speech therapy and speech defects. We came up with the game
        together, its basis will be the connection between parents and children
        and especially the effort to pronounce either letters or words
        correctly. There will be levels in the game where the children will
        perform tasks.
